# Skills Directory

Repository-specific Codex skills should be stored in this directory.

- Place each skill in its own folder under `.github/skills/`.
- Include a `SKILL.md` file in each skill folder.
- Add any related references, scripts, or assets inside that skill folder.

Example:

```text
.github/skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md
    references/
    scripts/
    assets/
```
